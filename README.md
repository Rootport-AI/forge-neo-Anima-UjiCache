# UjiCache -Prototype

UjiCache -Prototype is a Forge Neo extension for experimenting with residual reuse and residual prediction during Anima / Cosmos-Predict2 T2I inference.

It was split out from the broader `Nz-Anima-PredLab` experiment set. This repository now exposes only the UjiCache prototype and a compact debug log mode.

## Current Features

- Forge Neo AlwaysVisible panel: `UjiCache -Prototype`
- Anima / Cosmos-Predict2 model detection
- UjiCache residual cache experiment for Anima block skipping
- Prediction formulas: `TeaCache (residual only)`, `Linear extrapolation`, and `Taylor2 curve`
- Auto Uji mode for CSV-driven UjiCache parameter sweeps
- Debug log mode with timing logs, diagnose logs, and optional UjiCache residual dump
- Runtime patch restore on disable, unsupported model, or unload

Logs are printed to the StabilityMatrix / Forge Neo console with the `[UjiCache]` prefix.

## Notes

UjiCache uses TeaCache-style skip decisions internally, but the standalone TeaCache experiment UI and all other PredLab experiments have been removed. The first model call is always a full calculation, and UjiCache falls back instead of using the cache when `previous_residual` is missing.

Forge Neo may pass unused kwargs such as `control` into `Anima.forward`; UjiCache ignores unused kwargs and consumes only the values it needs, especially `transformer_options`.

## Compatibility

- Target: StabilityMatrix Forge Neo / SD WebUI Forge Neo
- Primary workflow: txt2img with Anima / Cosmos-Predict2 T2I models
- Verified development environment: Windows, NVIDIA GPU, PyTorch CUDA build
- Not guaranteed: A1111 mainline, Forge classic, ComfyUI, multi-GPU, heavily modified pipelines
